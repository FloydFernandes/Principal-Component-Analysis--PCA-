# Principal Component Analysis-(PCA)
 PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used in thiss project to compress the data

## Project
This is a project on Wine dataset. This dataset has the information of differenttypes of wine and the content of it. There are 3 types of wine in total.

We have used PCA to reduce the number of features. We use the 3 Principal components as the compressed data. 

Then we use the K-means to compare how many clusters are made using the original data and how many clusters are made using the compressed data. If the numbers of clusters are same, we can say that we have successfully reduced the data and retained good amount of information.
